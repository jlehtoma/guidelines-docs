About rOpenGov
==============

The [rOpenGov](http://ropengov.github.io) is a community-driven ecosystem of R packages for open government data and computational social sciences.

A community of independent package developers around open goverment data analytics is now emerging at rOpenGov. Independent [projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) dedicated to open data streams relevant to computational social sciences have already joined in, providing dedicated R tools to access and analyze these information sources. The rOpenGov project was officially launched in 2013 and is overseen by a core team. We are now setting up the project and its infrastructure, and actively encouraging [new contributions]({{ site.url }}/contribute).

The rapidly emerging governmental and other open data streams provide novel opportunities for social sciences, data journalism, and citizen participation across the globe while computational tools to utilize these resources are lacking. A community-driven software ecosystem provides a scalable solution and a potential to revolutionize the field, taking advantage of the lessons learned in similar initiatives in other fields such as [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org) and [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org).

This umbrella site focusing on open government data R tools will give additional visibility for the participating projects, automated tools, an opportunity to attract contributors, and a forum for the developer community.

### Community

This a community project. A number of independent **package authors** have [contributed projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) that ease programmatic access to data sources relevant to computational social sciences. These packages are actively maintained by their developers. We encourage new contributions. If you are working on related projects, don't hesitate to [get in touch!]({{ site.url }}/contribute)

The **user community** includes academic researchers, students, data journalists, citizen scientists, and other interested parties.

The **core team** serves the developer and user community by maintaining the infrastructure, reviewing new packages, and proposing recommended guidelines. The core team members have background in computational science: [Leo Lahti](http://www.iki.fi/Leo.Lahti) (Univ. Helsinki, Finland and Wageningen Univ., Netherlands), [Juuso Parkkinen](http://ouzor.github.io/) (Aalto Univ., Finland) and [Joona Lehtom√§ki](https://github.com/jlehtoma) (University of Helsinki, Finland).

For general support regarding the development, maintenance, and usage of individual packages, [get in touch with the community]({{ site.url }}/contribute).

### Objectives

rOpenGov is an open source, open development software project to provide tools for the analysis and comprehension of data sources relevant to computational social sciences, inspired by [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/about/), a related and wildly successful R ecosystem project for life sciences. The rOpenGov project aims to promote the following aspects in its operation: **Statistical and graphical methods** The rOpenGov project provides computational tools dedicated to the analysis of data sources relevant to social sciences and related fields, thus complementing the overall R ecosystem for computational sciences.

**Documentation** The rOpenGov project produces high-quality documentation related to the analysis of data sources relevant for social sciences. Each rOpenGov package contains one or more vignettes. These provide a task-oriented, transparent and reproducible description of the package's functionality. The main vignettes are automatically converted into online tutorials published at the rOpenGov site.

**Scalability** To provide a shared software platform that enables the rapid development of extensible, scalable, and interoperable software. The open development model facilitates software improvements through bug fixing and software extension, and provides a workbench of tools that allow researchers to explore and expand the methods used to analyze data related to social sciences.

**Open source** The rOpenGov project has a commitment to full open source discipline, with distribution via Github, a public version control server. All contributions are released under an open source license to provide full access to algorithms and their implementation and to ensure that the international scientific community is the owner of the software tools needed to carry out research.

**Reproducible research** Software tools are available for assembling and processing data sources such as parliamentary data, economical and social indicators, and other sources. The automatically generated online tutorials provide fully transparent documentation with full algorithmic details. This will provide examples for good scientific computing, and advance scientific methodology, practice and understanding by providing high-quality tools for reproducible research.

**Open development** Users are encouraged to become developers, either by contributing rOpenGov compliant packages or documentation. Additionally rOpenGov provides a forum for linking together different groups with common goals to foster collaboration on software, often at the level of shared development. This can also help to train researchers on computational and statistical methods for the analysis of social science data. In addition, the rOpenGov project provides utilities for package developers, including TravisCI scripts for automated build reports, automatically generated online tutorials for the packages, shared distribution platform at the rOpenGov website, and added visibility and recognition for individual packages. The community fosters mutual support and feedback. 

### Language policy

The rOpenGov project is based on the R statistical programming language. Most rOpenGov components are distributed as R packages to access, preprocess, analyse, and report data and scientific findings. There may also be utility and metadata packages. In general, the package release versions are distributed through CRAN, and the development versions via the [rOpenGov Github organization](https://github.com/ropengov). The advantages of R include:

- Active developer community.
- Extensive experiences with similar community projects in other fields.
- A well established system for packaging together software with automated document generation.
- Access to on-line data sources.
- Support for rich statistical simulation and modeling activities.
- State-of-the-art visualization capabilities.
- A high-level interpreted language to easily prototype new computational methods.
- An object-oriented framework for addressing the diversity and complexity of problems in social sciences.

We have currently selected to focus on R due to its strong ecosystem and user community. We are actively monitoring the developments in other languages, such as Python and Julia. The language policy may be expanded in the future.
